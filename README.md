## Genotype

Genotype.RData contains the genotypes (M=28,916 for SNP markders) for 910 F2 pigs (N=910). If the file is loaded correctly, there should be an object named "geno" in the R environment.

## Adj_ph

Adj_ph.RData contains the adjusted ph value measured 24 hours after slaughter. If the file is loaded correctly, there should be an object named "y" in the R environment.
